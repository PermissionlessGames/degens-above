# Degens Above: Development Journey

## The Game Concept

Degens Above is an exciting blockchain-based game where players act as gods betting on and influencing chariot races. The game combines elements of chance, strategy, and divine intervention to create a unique gaming experience.

### Key Game Features:

- **Divine Betting**: Players place bets on chariot races using cryptocurrency
- **Miracles**: Players can reveal bets to earn "miracles" that can speed up or slow down chariots
- **Dynamic Races**: Each race features 16 chariots with varying speeds on randomly determined course lengths
- **Continuous Play**: A portion of each race's pot seeds the next race, creating an ongoing cycle

## Our Development Process

### Building the Core Game Mechanics

We started by implementing the fundamental structure of the game:

1. **Race Creation**: We built a system that generates new races with random attributes for each chariot
2. **Betting System**: We created a mechanism for players to place bets on their favorite chariots
3. **Race Progression**: We developed logic to determine how chariots move through the race course

### Enhancing the Race Experience

To make the races more exciting and accurate, we recently added a sophisticated position tracking system:

1. **Real-Time Positions**: The game now tracks each chariot's exact position throughout the race
2. **Global Snapshots**: When any chariot's speed changes, the game takes a "snapshot" of all chariots' positions
3. **Accurate Winner Determination**: Winners are now determined by actual distance traveled, not just finish time

This enhancement allows for:
- More accurate representation of photo finishes
- Better handling of speed changes during races
- A more fair and transparent way to determine winners

### Testing for Quality

Throughout development, we've maintained a rigorous testing process to ensure the game works as expected:

- Each game feature is thoroughly tested before implementation
- We simulate various race scenarios to ensure fairness
- Edge cases (like ties or unusual speed patterns) are carefully handled

## Challenges and Frustrations

Like any ambitious project, developing Degens Above came with its share of challenges:

### Technical Hurdles

- **Position Tracking Complexity**: Implementing an accurate position tracking system proved more complex than initially anticipated. We had to rethink our approach several times to ensure positions were calculated correctly across all race scenarios.
- **Smart Contract Limitations**: Working within the constraints of blockchain technology sometimes meant making difficult trade-offs between feature richness and gas efficiency.
- **Test Case Edge Scenarios**: Some race conditions were particularly challenging to test, especially those involving multiple chariots finishing at nearly identical times.

### Development Process Challenges

- **Maintaining Code Consistency**: As the codebase grew, ensuring consistent naming conventions and error handling became increasingly important but also more difficult.
- **Balancing Improvements vs. Stability**: We often faced the dilemma of whether to improve existing functionality or maintain stability of the core game mechanics.
- **Linter Errors**: Occasionally, linter errors would appear in unexpected places, requiring time to diagnose and fix issues that weren't immediately apparent from the error messages.

### Lessons Learned

These challenges taught us valuable lessons:

1. **Start with Clear Requirements**: Having well-defined requirements from the beginning helps avoid major redesigns later.
2. **Test Early and Often**: Comprehensive testing from the start saves significant debugging time later.
3. **Document Design Decisions**: Recording why certain approaches were chosen helps future developers understand the codebase.

Despite these challenges, overcoming each obstacle brought us closer to creating a truly engaging and unique gaming experience.

## Next Steps

As we continue developing Degens Above, we're focusing on:

1. **Miracle System**: Implementing the ability for players to use miracles to affect race outcomes
2. **User Interface**: Creating an intuitive and engaging front-end experience
3. **Economic Balance**: Fine-tuning the betting and reward systems for long-term sustainability

## Technical Foundation

While the details are complex, Degens Above is built on blockchain technology that ensures:

- Complete transparency in race outcomes
- Secure handling of player bets
- Verifiable randomness in race generation
- Permanent record of race results

We're excited to continue developing this unique gaming experience where players can test their luck, exercise strategy, and occasionally bend the rules of the race with divine intervention!
